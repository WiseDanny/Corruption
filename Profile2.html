<p>Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea since 1979, has one of the longest-standing administrations in Africa.Equatorial Guinea’s vast oil resources, the majority of its citizens live in poverty, with limited access to adequate healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Obiang's son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (commonly known as Teodorín), who is the vice president, has faced multiple investigations in countries like France and the United States. These cases have revealed details about the family’s extravagant spending and high-value assets, suspected to have been purchased with state funds.
