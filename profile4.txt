<p>Bashir reportedly amassed vast personal wealth despite his official salary as president being modest. Investigations following his removal revealed that he stored large amounts of cash in his residence, amounting to millions in U.S. dollars, euros, and Sudanese pounds. This money, believed to be embezzled from public funds or foreign aid, reflected the scale of alleged misappropriation under his rule. Under Bashir, government contracts and lucrative business opportunities were often awarded to allies, securing loyalty and control within key sectors of the economy.</p>
