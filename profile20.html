<p>Bamba Banja, a former senior official in The Gambia's Ministry of Fisheries, became a high-profile figure in the country’s anti-corruption efforts after being implicated in a significant corruption scandal. His case highlighted longstanding issues of corruption in The Gambia's fisheries sector, a vital part of the national economy with substantial income from fishing licenses, exports, and partnerships with foreign companies.

Banja was accused of soliciting and accepting bribes in exchange for favorable treatment of foreign fishing companies, particularly in relation to fishing rights and licenses. Reports suggest that he used his position to grant permissions and overlook potential regulatory violations in return for payments from companies looking to operate in Gambian waters. This alleged misconduct compromised the enforcement of fishing regulations, which are crucial to protecting the sustainability of fish stocks, and raised concerns about the environmental and economic impacts on the country.

The scandal surrounding Banja underscored the issue of regulatory capture, where officials who should be enforcing the law instead exploit their roles for personal gain. The fishing sector in The Gambia is susceptible to overfishing and exploitation, and corruption at the regulatory level can exacerbate these issues, ultimately harming local communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods. Banja’s actions, according to allegations, created an environment where foreign operators could operate with little oversight, potentially leading to environmental degradation and loss of revenue for the state.  </p>
