<p>After the 2020 coup, a transitional government was set up with Bah Ndaw, a civilian, as the interim president, and Goita as the vice president.In May 2021, Goita led a second coup, ousting the transitional president Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. The justification for this second coup was that the civilian leaders had violated the terms of the transition by attempting to remove military officers from key positions within the government.  Goita's regime has been accused of human rights violations, including suppression of protests, censorship of media, and crackdowns on opposition groups. The political situation in Mali remains highly volatile, and despite his pledges to organize elections, many believe that Goita intends to maintain control over the government for the foreseeable future. </p>
