<p>During his fatherâ€™s presidency, Karim held several influential government positions, managing key sectors such as infrastructure, international cooperation, and energy. However, his rapid rise and control over significant parts of Senegal's economy raised suspicions, with accusations that he misused his political power to amass wealth through questionable means.

Karim was widely criticized for allegedly creating an extensive network of businesses and assets under his control or through associates and family members. His influence in awarding government contracts, especially in sectors like construction and energy, allowed him to favor certain companies, often securing contracts without transparent bidding processes. These practices enabled him to maintain a strong grip over some of Senegal's most lucrative projects, leading to accusations that he used his position to enrich himself rather than prioritize public interest.

The scale of his wealth came under scrutiny after his father left office in 2012, and Senegalese authorities launched investigations into his finances. Prosecutors accused Karim of embezzling public funds and holding assets worth over $1 billion, spread across various businesses and properties in Senegal and abroad.   </p>
