<p>Under Afwerkiâ€™s government, Eritrea has a command economy where the state tightly controls all major sectors, including mining, trade, and telecommunications. Eritrea is rich in natural resources, particularly gold and other minerals, which have drawn interest from foreign companies. However, deals in the mining sector are often criticized for their lack of transparency, with revenues and profits from resource extraction remaining undisclosed. Critics argue that these profits primarily benefit high-ranking government officials rather than the general population, which struggles with poverty and limited economic opportunities.  </p>
