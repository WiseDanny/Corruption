<p>In 2020, Obadiah Moyo was arrested and charged with corruption and fraud. The allegations suggested that he had facilitated the awarding of government contracts to unqualified companies in exchange for kickbacks. The contracts were related to the procurement of COVID-19 equipment, and it was claimed that these transactions led to the government overpaying for goods that were not up to standard or were not delivered at all.</p>
