<p>One major area of concern is Ruto’s significant wealth, which he reportedly amassed through large-scale investments in agriculture, real estate, and hospitality. While Ruto presents himself as a self-made businessman, critics argue that his financial success is largely due to leveraging political influence. For instance, questions have been raised about land acquisitions, particularly those related to properties allegedly acquired under questionable circumstances. One such controversy involved a land dispute with the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) over property near Nairobi’s Wilson Airport. Although Ruto denies any wrongdoing, these types of disputes have fueled public concern about how public lands and resources are handled by politically connected individuals.

Additionally, Ruto’s political career has been closely linked with various corruption cases in Kenya. During his tenure as Deputy President under former President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya was embroiled in several high-profile corruption scandals involving public funds, including in sectors such as healthcare and infrastructure.  </p>
