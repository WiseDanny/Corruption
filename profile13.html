<p>Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, a former president of the Comoros, has been embroiled in significant corruption allegations stemming from his administration’s involvement in a controversial "economic citizenship" program. Initially intended as a revenue-generating initiative, the program offered Comorian citizenship to foreign investors, particularly targeting individuals from Gulf countries, in exchange for large fees. However, this program became a focal point for allegations of widespread corruption, mismanagement, and exploitation, leading to considerable public and legal backlash.

Under Sambi’s leadership, the economic citizenship scheme reportedly spiraled into a large-scale scandal. Authorities later accused Sambi of enabling the sale of Comorian passports on a massive scale, with proceeds allegedly being diverted away from public funds and into private accounts controlled by Sambi and his associates.   </p>
