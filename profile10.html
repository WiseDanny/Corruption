<p>Alpha Condé, the former president of Guinea, who held office from 2010 until his ousting in 2021, faced numerous allegations of corruption and abuse of power during his presidency. Initially elected on promises of reform and transparency, Condé’s time in office instead became marked by accusations of authoritarianism and mismanagement, particularly in Guinea’s lucrative mining sector, which is one of the largest global sources of bauxite, essential for aluminum production.

Condé’s administration was accused of misusing the country’s natural resources for personal and political gain. Under his leadership, international mining contracts were often awarded without transparency, sparking claims that he and his inner circle benefited financially. Many of these contracts were granted to foreign companies on favorable terms, leading to suspicions that kickbacks were involved.   </p>
