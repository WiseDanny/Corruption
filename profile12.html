<p>CAR is rich in natural resources, yet many deals made under Touadéra's administration have raised suspicions due to their lack of transparency. These agreements often appear to favor foreign entities with close ties to government officials, leading to concerns that public resources are being exploited for personal gain. Critics argue that the revenue from these contracts rarely benefits the general population, which remains impoverished and lacks access to essential services.

Touadéra’s administration has also faced accusations related to the presence of private security firms, such as the Russian-linked Wagner Group, which has played a significant role in security operations in the CAR. While ostensibly hired to support the government in fighting insurgencies, reports suggest that these groups may be involved in exploiting CAR’s resources, and questions have arisen about how these agreements are structured and the extent of Touadéra’s personal involvement.  </p>
